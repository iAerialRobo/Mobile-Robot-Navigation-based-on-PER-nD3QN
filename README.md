# Mobile-Robot-Navigation-based-on-PER-n2D3QN

This is the soure code of autonomous navigation for mobile robots. The proposed algorithm is called PER-n2D3QN, which integrates prioritized experience replay, noisy network with factorized Gaussian
noise, n-step learning, and dueling structure into double deep Q-network. This combination enhances the efficiency of experience replay, facilitates exploration, and provides more accurate Q
value estimates, thereby significantly improving the performance of autonomous navigation for mobile robots.
